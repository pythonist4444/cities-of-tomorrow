# 🏙️ Cities of Tomorrow: Urban Growth & Sustainability

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Microsoft Fabric Data Days Notebooks Contest** under the theme **"Cities of Tomorrow – Urban Growth & Sustainability."** It explores the relationship between urban density, sustainability, and livability, challenging the common misconception that high population density leads to low sustainability. By leveraging data science techniques, the project identifies actionable insights to guide urban planning and policy-making.

## Key Highlights

- **Author:** [Olamide Fakorede](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulafeezfakorede/)
- **GitHub Profile:** [pythonist4444](https://github.com/pythonist4444?tab=repositories)
- **Dataset:** 3,400+ cities with features related to urban planning, sustainability, and livability.
- **Objective:** Decode the "Density Myth" and identify the true drivers of urban sustainability.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and engineer features such as `Eco_Density_Ratio`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize the trade-offs between urban growth and green space.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning to identify the top drivers of the `Urban Sustainability Score`.
4. **Clustering:** Segment cities into archetypes to guide urban planning and policy recommendations.

## Key Findings

1. **Density is Not Destiny:** Population density has a negligible impact on urban sustainability.
2. **The Green Imperative:** Green cover percentage is the most critical predictor of a livable city, contributing ~47% to sustainability outcomes.
3. **City Archetypes:** Using K-Means clustering, cities were grouped into three distinct clusters:
   - **Cluster 0:** High disaster risk, high crime rates, and low sustainability.
   - **Cluster 1:** Moderate sustainability, with low crime but lacking green cover and renewable energy.
   - **Cluster 2:** High sustainability, leveraging green spaces and renewable energy.
